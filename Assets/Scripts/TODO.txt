- keep camera sizing for width/height weight
- add anchor points on edges and to middle


NEEDS

- should be inuitive to use
- should be performant
- exact replica or just basic/ primary utility ?

Pain points: stretching/sizing

TODO

two anchor
    pos
    size
    
    size + anchor diff, if anch = point then size = size
    
drawgizmos + drawgizmos selected








uinode + uielement ??


just handle positioning, rest can be seperate.


Change camera size if it is horizontal?

Make it really simple.




- Complete get NodePosition
- Add CUSTOM raycasting and their events, click, drag etc
- Add ContainerNode
- Add SCROLL (pooling, dynamic generation, emitting event upward so it can scroll)

- make the rootnode as a whole scene canvas so you dont need to pass camera around.
- make pivoting natural

- remove size inspector for sprite renderer


NOTES
- Child logic for anchoring/parenting?
- No child logic, enter yourself (generate for scroll pool)
